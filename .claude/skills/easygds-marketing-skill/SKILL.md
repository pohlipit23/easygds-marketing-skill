# easyGDS Marketing & Sales Content Generator

Generate on-brand marketing and sales materials for easyGDS.

## Formatting Guidelines

**Non-negotiable:**
- **Dates**: Always use DD/MM/YYYY format (e.g., 01/01/2026)
- **Numbers**: Use metric system only (km, kg, Celsius) - never imperial units
- **Currency**: Specify currency symbol (e.g., £1M, €500K, $2.5M)
- **Time format**: 24-hour format preferred (e.g., 14:30, not 2:30 PM)

## Before Creating Content

1. Read `references/brand-guidelines.md` - tone, writing rules, guardrails
2. Identify target audience (Airlines, Travel Agents, Loyalty & Retail, Other)

## Writing Rules

**Style:**
- Short sentences, active voice - you're busy and so are they
- NO buzzwords or jargon (no "leverage", "synergy", "unlock potential", "game-changing", "revolutionary")
- Problem-solving orientation - lead with their challenge, not your solution
- Specific numbers over vague claims (use actual data from references)
- If it sounds impressive but says nothing, delete it

**Structure (all content types):**
1. **Hook:** Start with their problem, industry trend, or strategic challenge
2. **Credibility:** Brief proof you understand their world (specific examples)
3. **Solution:** How easyGDS solves it (features as solution to their problem)
4. **Proof:** Real numbers, named clients, specific outcomes
5. **CTA:** Single, clear next step

## Airline Research Methodology

**Purpose:** Create contextual, informed outreach by understanding the airline's current situation before writing.

### When to Research

Research is required for:
- Sales emails to specific airlines
- Airline-focused landing pages or pitch decks
- Content that references specific airline situations

Skip research for:
- Generic industry content
- User already provided airline information
- Follow-up emails where research was already done

### Research Process

**Step 1: Ask User First**

Before starting research, present options:
```
I can research [Airline Name] to create contextual outreach, or you can provide information directly.

Option A: I'll research (takes ~8 minutes):
- Holiday brand and booking capabilities
- Hotel/OTA partnerships
- Recent news on ancillary strategy
- Loyalty program scope

Option B: You provide key information:
- Does the airline have a holiday brand?
- Any known partnerships or recent news?
- Specific angle you want to take?

Which would you prefer?
```

**Step 2: Conduct Research** (if user chooses automated research)

**Phase 1: Web Search Intelligence** (using mcp__web-search-prime__webSearchPrime)

Execute 4 strategic searches:

1. **Holiday Brand Discovery**
   - Query: `"[Airline] Holidays" OR "[Airline] vacation packages"`
   - Look for: Official pages, branded products, press releases

2. **Partnership Intelligence**
   - Query: `"[Airline] hotel partnership" OR "[Airline] Booking.com" OR "[Airline] Expedia"`
   - Look for: White-label deals, OTA partnerships, powered-by mentions

3. **Non-Air Ancillary Strategy**
   - Query: `"[Airline] non-air ancillary" OR "[Airline] ancillary revenue strategy 2026"`
   - Look for: Executive quotes, investor presentations, strategy announcements

4. **Loyalty & Travel Products**
   - Query: `"[Airline] [loyalty program name] redemption hotels" OR "[Airline] frequent flyer travel products"`
   - Look for: Redemption options, travel marketplace, partner programs

**Phase 2: Website Deep Dive** (using mcp__web-reader__webReader)

1. **Home Country Site**
   - Construct URL using home country domain in English
   - Examples:
     - Lufthansa: `lufthansa.com/de/en`
     - Qatar Airways: `qatarairways.com/en-qa/homepage.html`
     - Ethiopian: `ethiopianairlines.com`

2. **Holiday Platform Inspection** (if found)
   - Visit the holiday/packages website
   - **Critical:** Test actual booking flow - click "Book Now"
   - Verify: Real booking engine vs. enquiry form
   - Check for: Dynamic pricing, payment integration, instant confirmation

3. **Site Search Verification**
   - Use airline's own search: Search for "holidays", "stopover", "hotel"
   - Verify products are actively promoted (not just old pages)
   - Check integration with main booking flow

**Phase 3: Booking Capability Verification**

**Red flags for enquiry-only (no real booking):**
- "Contact us for pricing"
- "Request a quote" or "Enquiry form"
- Form asks for "preferred dates" (not actual availability)
- No prices displayed
- No payment gateway
- Email-only contact method

**Green flags for real booking engine:**
- Calendar with actual availability
- Prices displayed in real-time
- Passenger details collection
- Payment integration
- Instant confirmation

**Phase 4: Classification**

Classify airline into scenario:

- **A1 - Brand + Content, NO Tech** ⭐⭐⭐ **PRIME TARGET**
  - Has holiday brand, no booking engine (enquiry forms only)
  - Approach: "Add tech to make it transactional"

- **A2 - Full Holiday Platform** ⭐
  - Has brand + full booking engine
  - Approach: "Expand globally" or "Upgrade tech"

- **B - OTA White-Label** ⭐⭐
  - Booking.com/Expedia powers hotel section
  - Approach: "Own the customer, don't hand off"

- **C - Affiliate Links** ⭐⭐
  - Redirects to external sites
  - Approach: "Capture revenue you're losing"

- **D - No Holiday Offering** ⭐⭐⭐
  - Nothing found
  - Approach: "Untapped opportunity"

- **E - Insufficient Data**
  - Research inconclusive
  - Approach: Neutral industry problem statement

**Step 3: Save Research Brief**

Save to: `output/research-[airline-slug]-[YYYYMMDD].md`

Include:
- Executive summary with classification
- Holiday brand & offerings (with booking verification)
- Technology partners (hotels, platforms)
- Loyalty & redemption scope
- Recent news & strategy
- Recommended approach angle
- Proof points to use
- What to avoid mentioning
- Source URLs

**Step 4: Create Content Using Research**

Reference research brief to:
- Lead with their specific situation
- Use timely hooks (recent announcements)
- Avoid mentioning competitors they already work with
- Choose relevant proof points
- Craft contextual subject lines

### Research Quality Checklist

Before using research, verify:
- [ ] Did I test the booking flow (not just trust web search)?
- [ ] Did I use site search to verify active promotion?
- [ ] Are findings from official sources (last 12-24 months)?
- [ ] Have I identified a specific strategic gap or opportunity?
- [ ] Can I reference something specific (not generic industry trends)?
