## 🎯 Fundamentals

### Obvious Choice
Airline holiday platforms & content (white-label tech + inventory for airlines to capture their customers' hotel/activity bookings)

### Ideal Customer
National flag carriers with strong hub-and-spoke networks (e.g., Qatar Airways, Emirates) who can leverage both stopover solutions to promote their country AND airline holiday platforms to capture travel revenue

### Core Problem
Revenue leakage - airlines capture only flight revenue while losing all non-air revenue (hotels, activities, car rentals) to OTAs

### Core Product
All-in-one white-label travel retail platform - complete tech stack, global inventory (1M+ hotels, 250k+ activities), and Merchant of Record services

### Primary Marketing Channels
Direct outbound (email/LinkedIn to C-level execs), industry events (Routes, IATA conferences), referrals from existing airline clients

### Geography
Global approach - targeting top 20 flag carriers worldwide

## 🏰 Competitive Moats

### Moat #1: Cornered Resource
Exclusive Tripovo inventory access and Amadeus partnership competitors can't replicate

### Moat #2: Switching Costs
Deep integration into airline booking flows and operations makes switching prohibitively expensive

### Moat #3: Cost Leadership
Lowest-cost provider in the market
