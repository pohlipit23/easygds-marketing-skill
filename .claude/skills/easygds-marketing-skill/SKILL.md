# easyGDS Marketing & Sales Content Generator

Generate on-brand marketing and sales materials for easyGDS.

## Formatting Guidelines

**Non-negotiable:**
- **Dates**: Always use DD/MM/YYYY format (e.g., 01/01/2026)
- **Numbers**: Use metric system only (km, kg, Celsius) - never imperial units
- **Currency**: Specify currency symbol (e.g., £1M, €500K, $2.5M)
- **Time format**: 24-hour format preferred (e.g., 14:30, not 2:30 PM)

## Before Creating Content

1. Read `references/brand-guidelines.md` - tone, writing rules, guardrails
2. Identify target audience (Airlines, Travel Agents, Loyalty & Retail, Other)
3. Read relevant sections of `references/products.md` and `references/tripovo-inventory.md`
4. For outreach emails, check `references/company.md` for team backgrounds and testimonials

## Writing Rules

**Style:**
- Short sentences, active voice - you're busy and so are they
- NO buzzwords or jargon (no "leverage", "synergy", "unlock potential", "game-changing", "revolutionary")
- Problem-solving orientation - lead with their challenge, not your solution
- Specific numbers over vague claims (use actual data from references)
- If it sounds impressive but says nothing, delete it

**Structure (all content types):**
1. **Hook:** Start with their problem, industry trend, or strategic challenge
2. **Credibility:** Brief proof you understand their world (specific examples)
3. **Solution:** How easyGDS solves it (features as solution to their problem)
4. **Proof:** Real numbers, named clients, specific outcomes
5. **CTA:** Single, clear next step
